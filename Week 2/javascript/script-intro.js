/* Challenge: Storing Personal Information

### MVP:

1. Create three variables to store your first name, last name and age.


1. Assign values to these variables.
1. Print a string containing all three variables in the console (should look like "Hi, my name is XXX XXX and I am XX years old) */

const firstName = "Tim";
const lastName = "Mclennan";

let age = 25;

console.log(
    "Hi, my name is" + firstname + lastName + "and I am" + age " years old."
);
